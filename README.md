# RAG-based Mental Health Chatbot

A customized mental health chatbot designed to provide empathetic support and mental health resources. This application utilizes **Google's Gemini** models and a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture to deliver context-aware responses grounded in verified documents.


## Features

- **Google Gemini Powered**: Leverages `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-2.5-flash` for intelligent, natural language understanding.
- **RAG Architecture**: Uses **FAISS** for efficient vector storage and retrieval, ensuring answers are relevant and based on provided context.
- **Conversational UI**: Built with **Chainlit** for a modern, chat-like experience.
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation memory to provide continuous and coherent support.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- A valid **Google API Key** (for Gemini models)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd RAG-based-Mental-Health-Chatbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Key**
   Ensure your Google API key is available. You can set it as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   # Or for Windows PowerShell:
   $env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
   *Note: The scripts currently contain hardcoded placeholders or environment variable checks. Please ensure these are set correctly in `Chatbot.ipynb`, `app.py`, and `app_gemini.py`.*

4. **Prepare the Knowledge Base**
   - Place your mental health PDF documents in `content/data/`.
   - Open `Chatbot.ipynb` and run all cells.
   - This will ingest the PDFs, chunk the text, and save the vector store locally (creating the `faiss_index_local` folder).

## Running the Chatbot

There are two versions of the application depending on the embeddings used:

### Option 1: Using HuggingFace Embeddings (Recommended)
This matches the default configuration in `Chatbot.ipynb`.
```bash
chainlit run app.py -w
```

### Option 2: Using Google Embeddings
If you modified the notebook to use `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` and saved to `faiss_index_gemini`:
```bash
chainlit run app_gemini.py -w
```

## detailed Tech Stack

- **LLM**: Google Gemini (`gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **Embeddings**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (HuggingFace) or `models/embedding-001` (Google)
- **Vector Store**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Orchestration**: LangChain
- **Frontend**: Chainlit
